# FBLAS Testing

For testing the FBLAS API, a set of test routines have been devised.
Each test program is identified with the following name `test_<blas_routine_name>`

The test program for a given routine can be executed by invoking `make test_<blas_routine_name>`

_Note_ WIP: currently, some of the FBLAS routines does not have the correspondending test.
